## Important Notes

### File Paths
- All file paths have been optimized for GitHub Pages
- Use relative paths (no leading `/` or `./`)
- Example: `Songs/playlist1/songs.json` ‚úÖ
- Example: `./Songs/playlist1/songs.json` ‚ùå

### Music Files
- Keep audio files under 25MB for GitHub Pages
- Use compressed formats like MP3
- Consider using external CDN for large files

### CORS Issues
- GitHub Pages serves files over HTTPS
- Audio files should work without CORS issues
- If you encounter issues, ensure all paths are relative

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 Errors**: Check that file paths are correct and relative
2. **Audio Won't Play**: Verify audio file formats and paths
3. **Images Not Loading**: Ensure image paths are relative
4. **Slow Loading**: Optimize audio file sizes

### Performance Tips

1. Compress audio files before uploading
2. Use appropriate image sizes for covers
3. Enable browser caching (already implemented)
4. Consider using a CDN for better performance

## Testing Your Deployment

1. Open your deployed URL
2. Check all playlists load correctly
3. Test audio playback
4. Verify responsive design on mobile
5. Test all controls (play, pause, next, previous, volume)

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:
1. Add a `CNAME` file with your domain name
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Update GitHub Pages settings with your custom domain
